# Refugee-Service-Bot
PathFinder_PWA.
PathFinder is a digital assistant I built that helps refugees find nearby local services based on their current location. 
PathFinder also answers most of the common questions refugees urgently need answers too. Most refugees want to know how to start small businesses and CBO's. 
A refugee can simple type in the keyword 'CBO'or 'small business' and PathFinder will instantly list the necessary requirements for creating one of the two. 
This Progressive Web App chatbot was built using Python programming language and some popular Python libraries such as Flask. I have integrated HTML, CSS and JS for designing the User Interface of the Web page. 
PathFinder consists of JavaScript features like Service Worker.js file and Manifest.json file. 
The Service Worker file enables offline usage and Manifest.json initializes a command for the PWA to be created. 
PathFinder is a work in progress. Although it could use some additional features like maps and so forth,
I most certainly believe it is user-friendly and highly supportive for a start-up.
Here is a full ZIP format of the chatbot below:
How to Run It:
- Make sure the app.py, /static and requirements.txt folders are seperate from each other in one repository.
- Run the code in your Python editor and you should recieve a Web adress that will directly take you to the Web page after you open it.
